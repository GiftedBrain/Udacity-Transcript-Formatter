# Udacity-Transcript-Formatter
A simple script that allows users to process Udacity's transcript .zip archives into a more readable format.

This was created using Python 3.4 and a rudimentary knowledge of Python's zipfile library.  It is entirely possible that things were used incorrectly in this code.

The excerpted subtitles included with the example were generated by Udacity.  The videos can be found here https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs101/l-48299949/m-48698544.  

I have included an example (non-archived) .srt file for comparison with the processed results found in /parsedTranscripts.
